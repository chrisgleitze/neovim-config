# Neovim config

## My Neovim journey
I started my neovim config by following along [ThePrimeagen's video](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?feature=shared), except for the LSP config he suggests. The LSP part seems a little outdated after only one year. That's how fast Neovim best practices move forward. From there on I looked for plugins I liked and tried those. I'll keep this repo updated, so you can always find the status quo of my neovim config here.

## My Neovim approach

I try to keep my Neovim config as lean as possible. I don't like to add dozens of plugins to Neovim. Then I could just as well use a JetBrains IDE. ;-)

A very helpful resource I consulted frequently is the ["Getting started with Neovim"](https://linovox.com/getting-started-with-neovim/) series by Linovox.

## Lesson learned

Update, July 2024: I now use ["Lazyvim"](https://www.lazyvim.org/), a Neovim distro (distribution). Why? Because I ran into too many issues that took me too long to solve.
Lesson: Better use a Neovim distro first to learn the tool. Then if you understood it well enough, you can write your own config.

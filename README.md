# Neovim config

## My Neovim journey
I started my neovim config by following along [ThePrimeagen's video](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?feature=shared) except for the LSP config he suggests. That one seems a little outdated after only one year. That's how fast Neovim best practices move forward. From there on I looked for plugins I liked and tried those. I'll keep this repo updated, so you can always find the status quo of my neovim config here.
